# Basic-Camera-Application
A console-based, very rough implementation of OpenCV 3.2 (C++), for testing OpenCV's capabilites. Needs OpenCV (>2) installed to build. Nothing fancy. Hit `Esc` to quit the program. Saves picture in the same directory as the created binary/executable file by the name "Your Picture.jpg".
